# Welcome to the R Girls Website!

https://r-girls.github.io/website/

This site is aimed primarily at teachers who want to use R in their lessons. See our example lesson plans and join us for a friendly chat on slack.

*This website was built completely in **R** using the `distill` package*  :smiley:
