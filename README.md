R Girls Website 

This is a website I designed using the distill package in R. The package builds the basics of the website and has several default settings.
You can see the website here: https://r-girls.github.io/website/

Current issues:
- On the homepage, there is so much extra white space that I can't figure out how to get rid of. I want the content to be in the center of the screen but not with all the extra white space. 
- Ideally, everything on the homepage would fit on one screen and there would be no scroll bars
- I was able to hide the small scroll bar but it ended up also affecting the footer so for now I added it back in because I definitely want to make sure the footer is always visible regardless of screen size. 

To add custom css go to rgirls-theme.css and see the code starting on line 77
- while you won't be able to change the actual code in this file, this can give you an idea of what I've tried
