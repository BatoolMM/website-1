# What is R-Girls?

The R-Girls School Network, or **R-Girls** for short, is an organization to promote the use of R in secondary schools particularly (but not exclusively) for girls. The goal of R-Girls is to inspire teachers to incorporate R into their everyday lesson plans. By using R in the classroom, students will be introduced to the amazing world of programming from a young age and in a fun, interactive way. 

For more information about this incredible organization, you can check out the [R-Girls website](https://r-girls.github.io/website/). On the website, you'll find many free lesson plans on a range of topics like Math, Science, and Geography. These lessons are created for everyone, regardless of whether you have years of coding experience or if you've never heard of R before. On the website, we also provide information and tutorials to help you get started. 

# How did I get involved with R-Girls?

Like most opportunities these days, I found out about R-Girls through networking and social media (shout out and thank you to Jenny Richmond!).

If you've read any of my previous blogs, you probably know that I love teaching R, especially to younger students. Unfortunately, in today's world there is still a stigma when it comes to girls and coding (and doing other STEM courses). Of course, I love teaching R to all students, but I am especially passionate about inspiring girls. I want to be a role model and show girls that coding can be fun and it's not just for boys. So, when I saw this tweet, I was very excited and couldn't wait to see if and how I could get involved. After getting in touch with the organizers and meeting some of the other members, I quickly realized how passionate everyone was to teach R, so I knew I fit in. 

# How have I contributed to R-Girls?

- Because I have experience building websites in R, I offered to help build the R-Girls website. I built the website in R using the `distill` package. Now, this is still a work in progress, but it's been such a fun and rewarding project. 
- I have also recorded a couple of short [tutorials](https://r-girls.github.io/website/getting_started.html) to help teachers, who may have no programming experience, get started.
- I was inspired by the lessons that others in the community already created, so I decided to have a crack at designing my own lesson plan. Understanding the importance of learning about climate change combined with the fact that I lived in Australia for 4 years, I decided to design a lesson around a data set on the average rainfall in major Australian cities over the past couple of decades. 

# Meeting R-Girls

R-Girls was founded by Green Oak Academy in the UK. I have been doing a lot of traveling this past year and I happened to be in the UK for a couple of months, so I was kindly invited to come and visit the school and teach my lesson to some of the girls. 

I had such a great day visiting the R-Girls School and teaching students in years 8, 9, and 10. I could tell that the girls were eager and excited to get started. 

## Stroop Task
Because I come from a cognitive psychology background, I thought it would be fun to start the lesson off with a demonstration of the [stroop task](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_stroop.html). The girls spent a few minutes going through this fun, mini experiment where you see colored words (like <pred>RED</pred> and <pblue>GREEN</pblue>) and have to respond to the color of the word not the meaning. We talked about reaction times and how people are often faster at responding to **congruent** words (where the color and the meaning match) compared to **incongruent** words (where the color and meaning do not match). The girls seemed to really enjoy this task/game. In fact, one girl explained she wished they could do "the game at the start of every lesson". 

## Rainfall Lesson Plan
Of course, we spent the majority of the time going through the R lesson plan, which can be found [here](https://r-girls.github.io/website/geography/2022-03-25-rainfalldatapost/). 

Here's a quick glimpse of what the data looks like:
<!-- #rainfall <- read_csv("_blog/2022-05-30-jennyrainfall/rainfall_clean.csv") -->

```{r}
rainfall <- read_csv("rainfall_clean.csv")

rainfall
```


The lesson objectives include:

- Learning how to read in data to RStudio
- Practicing how to view and explore the data
- Identifying the different variables in the dataset
- Creating a beautiful line graph in R using `ggplot2`
- Interpreting the plot to see how average rainfall has changed over the last 20 years


Check out the final plot below! Notice that this was created in just a few lines of code.

```{r}
rainfall_plot <- ggplot(rainfall, aes(x = year, y = avg_rainfall, color = city_name)) +
  geom_line()
rainfall_plot
```


# Final Thoughts 

Being part of the R-Girls community has been a wonderful experience - it is a warm, friendly, and incredibly collaborative environment. I have learned so much from the other members and hopefully they can say the same for me. This is a worldwide community project, so if you wish to contribute please get in touch via [Slack](https://r-girls.slack.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/R_Girls_School) or [email](mailto:rgirlsschool@gmail.com).

I'm so proud to be part of the R-Girls community and grateful for the opportunity to go and visit the R-Girls School in person! I had such a blast meeting and teaching the girls. The girls seems to be very engaged in the lesson and we got a lot of positive feedback. I thought it would be fun to take the girls' feedback and create a wordcloud! So, I'll end with sharing the wordcloud that I created using the `wordcloud` and `RColorBrewer` packages in R (I also followed along to [this short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVVvG035vQc)) `r emo::ji("smile")`
