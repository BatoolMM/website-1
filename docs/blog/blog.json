Their goal is to inspire\r\nteachers to incorporate R into their everyday lesson plans. By using R\r\nin the classroom, students will be introduced to the amazing world of\r\nprogramming from a young age and in a fun, interactive way.\r\nFor more information about this incredible organization, you can\r\ncheck out the\r\nR-Girls\r\nwebsite. There you will find many free lesson plans on a range of\r\ntopics including Math, Science, and Geography. These lessons are created\r\nfor everyone, regardless of whether you have years of coding experience\r\nor you‚Äôve never heard of R before. If you are new to R there are plenty\r\ntutorials and resources available that will help get you started on your\r\nR journey.\r\nHow did I get involved with\r\nR-Girls?\r\nLike most opportunities these days, I found out about R-Girls through\r\nnetworking and social media (shout out and thank you to Jenny\r\nRichmond!).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love teaching R, especially to younger students. One of my goals is\r\nto share my knowledge and inspire students to want to learn to code.\r\nThis has translated into many blog articles and video tutorials covering\r\nan array of topics in R. I enjoy teaching all students, but am\r\nparticularly interested in mentoring girls as unfortunately, in today‚Äôs\r\nworld, there is still a stigma when it comes to girls and coding. I want\r\nto be a role model and show girls that coding can be fun and it‚Äôs not\r\njust for boys. So, when I saw this tweet, I was very excited and\r\ncouldn‚Äôt wait to see if and how I could get involved. After getting in\r\ntouch with the organizers and meeting some of the other members, I\r\nquickly realized how passionate everyone was to teach R, so I knew I fit\r\nin.\r\nHow have I contributed to\r\nR-Girls?\r\nBecause I have experience building websites in R, I offered to help\r\nbuild the\r\nR-Girls\r\nwebsite. I built the website in R using the distill\r\npackage. Now, this is still a work in progress, but it‚Äôs been such a fun\r\nand rewarding project.\r\nI have also recorded a couple of short\r\ntutorials\r\nto help teachers, who may have no programming experience, get\r\nstarted.\r\nI was inspired by the lessons that others in the community already\r\ncreated, so I decided to have a crack at designing my own lesson plan.\r\nUnderstanding the importance of learning about climate change combined\r\nwith the fact that I lived in Australia for 4 years, I designed a lesson\r\naround a data set on the average rainfall in major Australian cities\r\nover the past couple of decades.\r\nMeeting R-Girls\r\nR-Girls was founded by\r\nGreen\r\nOak Academy in the UK and I was kindly invited to visit the school\r\nand teach my lesson to some of the girls. I was excited to have the\r\nopportunity to teach students in years 8, 9, and 10. I couldn‚Äôt wait to\r\nmeet everyone and get started!\r\nStroop Task\r\nI come from a cognitive psychology background, so I thought it would\r\nbe fun to start the lesson off with a demonstration of the\r\nStroop\r\nTask The girls spent a few minutes going through this fun, mini\r\nexperiment where you see colored words (like RED and\r\nGREEN) and have to respond to the color of the word not\r\nthe meaning. We talked about reaction times and how people are often\r\nfaster at responding to congruent words (where the\r\ncolor and the meaning match) compared to incongruent\r\nwords (where the color and meaning do not match). The girls seemed to\r\nreally enjoy this task/game. In fact, one girl explained she wished they\r\ncould do ‚Äúthe game at the start of every lesson‚Äù.\r\nRainfall Lesson Plan\r\nOf course, we spent the majority of the time going through the R\r\nlesson plan, which can be found\r\nhere.\r\nThe lesson objectives include:\r\nLearning how to read in data to RStudio\r\nPracticing how to view and explore the data\r\nIdentifying the different variables in the dataset\r\nCreating a beautiful line graph in R using ggplot2\r\nInterpreting the plot to see how average rainfall has changed over\r\nthe last 20 years\r\nHere‚Äôs a quick glimpse of what the data looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrainfall <- read_csv(\"rainfall_clean.csv\")\r\n\r\nrainfall\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 112 √ó 3\r\n   city_name  year avg_rainfall\r\n   <chr>     <dbl>        <dbl>\r\n 1 Adelaide   2000        1.53 \r\n 2 Adelaide   2001        1.71 \r\n 3 Adelaide   2002        0.996\r\n 4 Adelaide   2003        1.49 \r\n 5 Adelaide   2004        1.41 \r\n 6 Adelaide   2005        1.61 \r\n 7 Adelaide   2006        0.757\r\n 8 Adelaide   2007        1.27 \r\n 9 Adelaide   2008        1.03 \r\n10 Adelaide   2009        1.34 \r\n# ‚Ä¶ with 102 more rows\r\n\r\nCheck out the final plot below! Notice that this was created in just\r\na few lines of code.\r\n\r\n\r\nrainfall_plot <- ggplot(rainfall, aes(x = year, y = avg_rainfall, color = city_name)) +\r\n  geom_line()\r\nrainfall_plot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nBeing part of the R-Girls community has been a wonderful experience -\r\nit is a warm, friendly, and incredibly collaborative environment. I have\r\nlearned so much from the other members and hopefully they can say the\r\nsame for me. This is a worldwide community project, so if you wish to\r\ncontribute please get in touch via\r\nSlack,\r\nTwitter\r\nor email.\r\nI‚Äôm so proud to be part of the R-Girls community and grateful for the\r\nopportunity to go and visit the R-Girls School in person! I had such a\r\nblast meeting and teaching the girls. The girls were very engaged in the\r\nlesson and we got a lot of positive feedback. I‚Äôll end by sharing a\r\nwordcloud of the students‚Äô feedback that I created using the R\r\nwordcloud and RColorBrewer packages (I also\r\nfollowed along to\r\nthis\r\nshort tutorial) üòÑ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nMy name is Nasrin F. Attar. I have a Ph.D.¬†in water resources\r\nengineering and I am currently working as a university lecturer at UUT\r\n(Urmia University of Technology) and guest professor at UU (Urmia\r\nUniversity) teaching lessons on ‚Äúwater resources engineering‚Äù, ‚Äúwater\r\nresources projects‚Äù and ‚Äúwater structures‚Äù.\r\nFor the water structure lesson, I teach my students about hydraulic\r\nstructures such as dams, weirs, spillways, etc. For dams, I ask each of\r\nmy students to consider a country and search for its dams. This year I\r\nused the R-Girls ready made Mapping lesson in my classroom. Students\r\nfound the dams on GoogleEarth and showed the dam types and their 3D\r\nlocation and then used R code which is currently posted on the RGirlsschool\r\nwebsite.\r\nIt is a fantastic, informative code used to teach school girls how to\r\nfind a place in the world by its longitude and latitude coordinates. As\r\nnot all the students were familiar with R, I gave them some tips to get\r\nstarted and then asked them to find the dam locations using R code. It\r\nwas nice to see how quickly all the students progressed with this task\r\nand see their enjoyment.\r\nR-Girls-Schools is a worldwide network to promote the use of R ‚Äî a\r\nleading data science programming language ‚Äî in secondary schools for\r\ngirls, founded by Green Oak Academy, Birmingham UK. This site consists\r\nof different coding examples for teen girls. It was a great experience\r\nfor me to use their ready made lessons in my teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
