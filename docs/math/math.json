Knit for the final time when you have completed the lesson. This final output file will be the one your teacher marks.\r\nWrite your code in the code chunks.\r\nYou can run your R code chunk in the Markdown file by clicking on the little arrow on the right of the chunk.\r\nWhat is a box plot\r\nA box plot is a way to show the shape or distribution of a set of data. It shows five useful features of the data, known as the five number summary.\r\nMinimum - the smallest valueÂ  Maximum - the largest value\r\nMedian - the middle or 50% value\r\nLower quartile - the value half way between the minimum and the median or 25% value\r\nUpper quartile - the value half way between the median and the maximum or 75% value\r\nThe difference between the upper and lower quartile is known as the inter-quartile range (IQR)\r\nWorked Example 1\r\nZaynab keeps a record of her journey times to school each morning. The times are to the nearest minute:\r\n29,21,16,25,21,19,18,30,21,21,12,26,19,21,20,19,30,29,16,21,18,18,27,18,20\r\nLet us draw a box plot and obtain the five number summary and the inter-quartile range (IQR). We will do this in three steps.\r\nThe R code in chunk1 tells R to store all the times into a variable called y and then to use these times to draw a box plot of the data.\r\n\r\n\r\ny <- c(29,21,16,25,21,19,18,30,21,21,12,26,19,21,20,19,30,29,16,21,18,18,27,18,20)\r\nboxplot(y, xlab=\"Times (mins)\", horizontal=T)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help us read values from the box plot it is useful to have gridlines on the plot.\r\nHere is a simple trick to get gridlines on the plot.\r\nThe code in chunk2 tells R to use the numbers it store in variable y to draw a box plot and then to add grid lines.\r\nClick on the little arrow on the right of the code chunk. The box plot will be drawn below the chunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n# we can calculate the five number summary like this\r\nboxplot(y, xlab=\"Times (mins)\", horizontal=T)\r\nGrid()\r\nboxplot(y, xlab=\"Times (mins)\", horizontal=T, add=T)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can also get R to calculate the five number summary for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n# we can calculate the five number summary like this\r\nsummary(y) # five number summary but also provides the mean\r\n\r\n\r\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Remember to replace the example data with the new dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow use the code in chunk2 to add grid lines to your box plot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow calculate the five number summary using code in chunk3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked Example 2\r\nBelow are the percentage exam marks out of 100 for Maths and English.\r\nMaths (%): 98,79,51,54,62,61,56,87,70,60,93,51,52,54,68\r\nEnglish (%): 37,50,58,45,93,47,47,45,38,61,65,46,97,99,54\r\nProduce two box plots side by side\r\n\r\n\r\nmaths <- c(98,79,51,54,62,61,56,87,70,60,93,51,52,54,68)\r\nenglish <- c(37,50,58,45,93,47,47,45,38,61,65,46,97,99,54)\r\nboxplot(maths, english, xlab=\"Marks%\", names=c(\"Maths\", \"English\"), horizontal=T)\r\nGrid()\r\nboxplot(maths, english, xlab=\"Marks%\", names=c(\"Maths\", \"English\"), horizontal=T, add=T)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(maths)\r\n\r\n\r\n   Min. 1st Qu.
