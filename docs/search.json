This will allow us to share all of our code online and will make it easier for us to help answer all of your coding questions.\r\nThis platform is completely free for you to use, but you will need to set up an account. To do so, please follow the instructions below:\r\nGo to your email and find the invitation to RStudio Cloud and open the link (we will let you know when we‚Äôve sent you the invite)\r\nClick ‚ÄúSign Up‚Äù and enter your details (email, create a password, name)\r\nOnce you do this, you‚Äôll have to go back to your email and verify your account/email address\r\nNavigate back to the RStudio Cloud page and click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù\r\nYou should be set! To confirm, go to the ‚ÄúMembers‚Äù tab and search for your name on the members list and check that you have the role ‚Äúcontributor‚Äù\r\nFeel free to also check out the About tab\r\nIf you have any issues, please let us know on Slack\r\nR & RStudio\r\nRStudio Cloud is great for beginners and getting started with R, but you will eventually want to work on your own computers. So, after the first couple of workshops, we will show you how to transfer all of your files to your local computers (as opposed to working on the cloud). To do this, you will need to have both R and RStudio installed.\r\nPlease have these installed/downloaded before Workshop #3\r\nYou can install R from the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website. I suggest downloading the latest version, which (as of the time of writing this workshop) is R 4.1.1\r\nR for Windows link\r\nR for Mac link\r\n\r\nYou can download RStudio here\r\nAlthough you need to have R installed, you will mostly likely never need to open R because you can do everything you need in RStudio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
