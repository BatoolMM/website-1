The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\r\n Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\r\n intended for use by those authorized to give the public\r\n permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\r\n copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\r\n irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\r\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\r\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\r\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\r\n material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\r\n material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\r\n licensed material, or material used under an exception or\r\n limitation to copyright.

Our\r\n licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\r\n other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\r\n the licensed material may still be restricted for other\r\n reasons, including because others have copyright or other\r\n rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\r\n such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\r\n Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\r\n respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\r\nSection 1 ‚Äì Definitions.\r\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\nAdapter‚Äôs License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\r\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\r\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\r\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\r\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\r\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\r\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\r\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\nSection 2 ‚Äì Scope.\r\nLicense grant.\r\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\nreproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\r\nproduce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\nExceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\r\nTerm. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\r\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\nnever produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\nDownstream recipients.\r\nOffer from the Licensor ‚Äì Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nNo downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\r\n\r\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nOther rights.\r\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\r\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\nSection 3 ‚Äì License Conditions.\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\r\nAttribution.\r\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\r\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\r\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\r\na copyright notice;\r\na notice that refers to this Public License;\r\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\r\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\nindicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\nindicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\r\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\r\nIf You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter‚Äôs License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\r\n\r\nSection 4 ‚Äì Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\r\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nSection 5 ‚Äì Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\nTO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 ‚Äì Term and Termination.\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 ‚Äì Other Terms and Conditions.\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 ‚Äì Interpretation.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Then we are going to practice writing the title and the labels to explain the bar chart. Finally, we are also going to practice changing the colour of the bars. After making each change, click on the ‚Äòknit‚Äô command at the top of the pane. After a short wait you will see the output file of your work. Check that the changes you made to the code have come out on the output file as you wanted them. eg You may have added a title for your bar chart in the code chunk in the R Markdown file, but perhaps the title has not been printed in the output file. Go back to the R Markdown file to check you put speech marks around it.\r\nOur data\r\nThis is the data we are going to use for the bar chart\r\nTable 1: Percentage of population with each blood group Now we will find out how to enter the data from the above table into R. Copy the following two lines of R code into chunk1 below. Make sure you paste the text between the top and bottom 3 back ticks. blood_group <- c(‚ÄòO‚Äô,‚ÄòA‚Äô,‚ÄòB‚Äô,‚ÄòAB‚Äô) pop_percentage <- c(44,42,10,4) The first line tells R to store these letters in a variable called blood_group The second line tells R to store the percentages in a variable called pop_percentage.\r\nBlood Group\r\nO\r\nA\r\nB\r\nAB\r\nPercentage of population\r\n44\r\n42\r\n10\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nTo check what R has stored in the variable blood_group, type blood_group inside code chunk2 and select the arrow on the far right of the chunk. R will tell you what it has stored. It should be the four blood groups\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nNow check what R has stored in the variable pop_percentage by typing pop_percentage in code chunk3. Click on the arrow on the far right of the chunk. R will tell you what it has stored. It should be the four percentage numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nLet‚Äôs check the percentage numbers add up to 100. Copy sum(pop_percentage) into code chunk 4 and click on the little arrow on the right of the chunk. What number does R print for you? Is it 100?\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nNow we will save the blood group and percentages data in a table (known as a tibble in R) called ‚Äòmydata‚Äô. This is so that the two variables can be combined into a single data table. Copy the following code into R chunk5. mydata <- tibble(blood_group, pop_percentage)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nLets check that ‚Äòmydata‚Äô has the correct information in it. Type mydata into code chunk6 and then click on the arrow on the right. Does the computer show you a little table with the correct information in?\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nDrawing a bar chart using our blood group data\r\nNow we have entered the data and checked that the data is correct we can tell R to plot a bar chart using these data. Copy and paste the three lines of R code into chunk7 and click on the little arrow on the right. ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage) + geom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)\r\nWhat does this code mean?\r\nggplot means ‚Äòdraw me a graph‚Äô\r\nmydata means ‚Äòuse the numbers in the mydata tibble‚Äô\r\naes is short for aesthetics and means ‚Äòwhat I want to see is‚Ä¶‚Äô\r\nx=blood_group means ‚Äòplot blood group on the x axis‚Äô\r\ny=pop_percentage means ‚Äòplot percentage of people on the y axis‚Äô\r\ngeom_bar means ‚Äòthe graph I want is a bar chart‚Äô\r\nstat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô means ‚Äòmake the bars as tall as the y values in the tibble‚Äô\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nCheck your bar chart. Are the bars black?\r\nWriting labels and title\r\nNow lets alter the labels and add a title so that the bar chart is clearer. Copy and paste the following R code into chunk8 then click on the little arrow on the right. ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage) + geom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)+ ylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô)+ xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+ ggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô) You have added some more instructions for R. What do they mean? ylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô) means ‚Äòmake this the label for the y axis‚Äô xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô) means ‚Äòmake this the label for the x axis‚Äô ggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)means ‚Äòmake this the title for the barchart‚Äô Note how there is a plus sign after each command\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nCheck your bar chart. Are the labels correct? Is the title correct? Are the bars still black? Well done!\r\nChanging the colour of the bars\r\nLet‚Äôs make it prettier. Let‚Äôs make the bars red.\r\nCopy and paste the R code below into chunk9 and click on the little arrow on the right ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage) + geom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô, fill = ‚Äòred‚Äô)+ ylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô)+ xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+ ggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nAre the bars red? Suggest what part of the code told R to make the bars red. Let‚Äôs make it even prettier. Copy and paste the following code into chunk10 ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage, fill = blood_group) + geom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)+ ylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô)+ xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+ ggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nWhat happened? Suggest what part of the code told R to colour the bars. How did R colour the bars? Well done! You have successfully completed your second R lesson. Now KNIT YOUR DOCUMENT for the final time. This is the version of your work that your teacher will mark.\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nLicense and Citation: You can use, modify, and adapt any of the lessons, but please include the following attribution: RGirls Community.
