Then we are going to practice writing\r\nthe title and the labels to explain the bar chart. Finally, we are also\r\ngoing to practice changing the colour of the bars. After making each\r\nchange, click on the ‚Äòknit‚Äô command at the top of the pane. After a\r\nshort wait you will see the output file of your work. Check that the\r\nchanges you made to the code have come out on the output file as you\r\nwanted them. eg You may have added a title for your bar chart in the\r\ncode chunk in the R Markdown file, but perhaps the title has not been\r\nprinted in the output file. Go back to the R Markdown file to check you\r\nput speech marks around it.\r\nOur data\r\nThis is the data we are going to use for the bar chart\r\nTable 1: Percentage of population with each blood group Now we\r\nwill find out how to enter the data from the above table into R. Copy\r\nthe following two lines of R code into chunk1 below. Make sure you paste\r\nthe text between the top and bottom 3 back ticks. blood_group <-\r\nc(‚ÄòO‚Äô,‚ÄòA‚Äô,‚ÄòB‚Äô,‚ÄòAB‚Äô) pop_percentage <- c(44,42,10,4) The first line\r\ntells R to store these letters in a variable called blood_group The\r\nsecond line tells R to store the percentages in a variable called\r\npop_percentage.\r\nBlood Group\r\nO\r\nA\r\nB\r\nAB\r\nPercentage of population\r\n44\r\n42\r\n10\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nTo check what R has stored in the variable blood_group, type\r\nblood_group inside code chunk2 and select the arrow on the far right of\r\nthe chunk. R will tell you what it has stored. It should be the four\r\nblood groups\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nNow check what R has stored in the variable pop_percentage by typing\r\npop_percentage in code chunk3. Click on the arrow on the far right of\r\nthe chunk. R will tell you what it has stored. It should be the four\r\npercentage numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nLet‚Äôs check the percentage numbers add up to 100. Copy\r\nsum(pop_percentage) into code chunk 4 and click on the little arrow on\r\nthe right of the chunk. What number does R print for you? Is it 100?\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nNow we will save the blood group and percentages data in a table\r\n(known as a tibble in R) called ‚Äòmydata‚Äô. This is so that the two\r\nvariables can be combined into a single data table. Copy the following\r\ncode into R chunk5. mydata <- tibble(blood_group, pop_percentage)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nLets check that ‚Äòmydata‚Äô has the correct information in it. Type\r\nmydata into code chunk6 and then click on the arrow on the right. Does\r\nthe computer show you a little table with the correct information\r\nin?\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nDrawing a bar\r\nchart using our blood group data\r\nNow we have entered the data and checked that the data is correct we\r\ncan tell R to plot a bar chart using these data. Copy and paste the\r\nthree lines of R code into chunk7 and click on the little arrow on the\r\nright. ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage) +\r\ngeom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)\r\nWhat does this code mean?\r\nggplot means ‚Äòdraw me a graph‚Äô\r\nmydata means ‚Äòuse the numbers in the mydata tibble‚Äô\r\naes is short for aesthetics and means ‚Äòwhat I want to see is‚Ä¶‚Äô\r\nx=blood_group means ‚Äòplot blood group on the x axis‚Äô\r\ny=pop_percentage means ‚Äòplot percentage of people on the y\r\naxis‚Äô\r\ngeom_bar means ‚Äòthe graph I want is a bar chart‚Äô\r\nstat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô means ‚Äòmake the bars as tall as the y values in\r\nthe tibble‚Äô\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nCheck your bar chart. Are the bars black?\r\nWriting labels and title\r\nNow lets alter the labels and add a title so that the bar chart is\r\nclearer. Copy and paste the following R code into chunk8 then click on\r\nthe little arrow on the right. ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group,\r\ny=pop_percentage) + geom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)+ ylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the\r\npopulation‚Äô)+ xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+ ggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)\r\nYou have added some more instructions for R. What do they mean?\r\nylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô) means ‚Äòmake this the label for the\r\ny axis‚Äô xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô) means ‚Äòmake this the label for the x axis‚Äô\r\nggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)means ‚Äòmake this the title for the\r\nbarchart‚Äô Note how there is a plus sign after each command\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nCheck your bar chart. Are the labels correct? Is the title correct?\r\nAre the bars still black? Well done!\r\nChanging the colour of the\r\nbars\r\nLet‚Äôs make it prettier. Let‚Äôs make the bars red.\r\nCopy and paste the R code below into chunk9 and click on the little\r\narrow on the right ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage)\r\n+ geom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô, fill = ‚Äòred‚Äô)+ ylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the\r\npopulation‚Äô)+ xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+ ggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood\r\nGroups‚Äô)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nAre the bars red? Suggest what part of the code told R to make the\r\nbars red. Let‚Äôs make it even prettier. Copy and paste the following code\r\ninto chunk10 ggplot(mydata) + aes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage, fill\r\n= blood_group) + geom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)+ ylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the\r\npopulation‚Äô)+ xlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+ ggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood\r\nGroups‚Äô)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nWhat happened? Suggest what part of the code told R to colour the\r\nbars. How did R colour the bars? Well done! You have successfully\r\ncompleted your second R lesson. Now KNIT YOUR DOCUMENT for the final\r\ntime.
