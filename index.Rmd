# Welcome!
We are delighted to announce that we are setting up a worldwide network to promote the use of R - a leading data science programming language - in secondary schools for girls.

This site is aimed primarily at teachers who want to use R in their lessons.  See our example lesson plans and join us for a friendly chat on slack.
